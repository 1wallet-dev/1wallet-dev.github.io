Since the number of skips is unknown to us and not tracked by Google Authenticator, we must account for all possible offsets. To do this, we must compute 3 OTP Merkle Trees, skipping the first 0, 1, 2 OTPs generated, respectively, before grouping the OTPs into tuples of three, and hash the tuples and use them as leaves. This design allows us to search in the list of leaves from each tree to find which one aligns with the tuple provided by the user. To achieve this, we construct the OTP Proof in a manner identical to computing OTP Proof with time-based OTP, except 3 consecutive OTPs are taken and concatenated before it is hashed and used to construct the proof.

An attack is possible by first compromising the client to obtain the OTP Merkle Trees, then finding a hashed value in the leaves sufficiently ahead of the current counter, then computing the 3-OTP tuple brute-force.
